 # Question 6

 Imagine that you are writing an automatic coaching app that gives feedback based on how much a person has run in a day compared to their goal.
 
 Create a constant called `targetDistance` of type `Double`.
 
 Create a variable called `currentDistanceRun` of type `Double`.
 
 Write a **single** if statement with multiple branches that provides feedback according to the following specifications:
 
 * when the person has run less than 10% of their target distance, print "Great start, keep it up!"
 * when the person has run between 45% and up to but not including 50% of their target distance, print "You're almost at halfway!"
 * when the person has run exactly half their target distance, print "Halfway there!"
 * when the person has run more than 90% of their target distance but not the entire target distance, print "Nearly done!"
 * when the person has run their entire target distance, print "GREAT JOB! You're finished the run."

// Answer question 6 below

let tagetDiastance : Double = 100
var currentDistanceRun : Double = 30
// this variable finds what percentage of the target distance you have done
var percentageRun = tagetDiastance / currentDistanceRun
if percentageRun  < 0.10 {
    print("Great start, keep it up!")
} else if percentageRun >= 0.45 && percentageRun < 0.50 {
    print("You're almost at halfway!")
} else if percentageRun == 0.5 {
    print("Halfway there!")
} else if percentageRun > 0.9 {
    print("Nearly done!")
} else if percentageRun == 1.0 {
    print("REAT JOB! You're finished the run.")
}
